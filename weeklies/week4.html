  <h1>WEEKLY 4: VEGGIE CYBERNETICS </h1>

        This series seems to explore how machines and computers have shaped society around us.
        Cybernetics is just another example of the ideology of machines seriously influencing individuals.
        This episode really showed the cultural impact of cybernetics, but what fascinated me the most was it stemming
        from an ecological standpoint.

        Forrester’s theory on overpopulation is reminiscent of Thomas Malthus’ theory, which similar end goals of
        zero growth in order for the Earth to be balanced. I feel that it was the strong belief for the world to be
        balanced in such chaos that made it so appealing. Especially as the world was entering this new age
        of computers, and when there are always new paradigms on the way, it is human nature to cling onto something
        that we can believe in.
