  <h1> WEEKLY 3: THE POOR IMAGE </h1>
  <body>
    <div>
      I had never considered poor images or ones of low quality to be a subject of a political matter. However,
      Hito Steyerl brings to mind many different issues that can be derived just from an image with lower resolution.
      One line that stuck out to me was how "Resolution was fetishized as if its lack amounted to the castration
      of the author." This reveals the contemporary hierarchy of images that is based off of resolution and
      was created out of visual culture.

      The way in which this piece was written felt like a conversation about class. This is highlighted further
      by calling low resolution images "poor" images. There is a certain stigma
      that comes with an image being of bad quality. Either that it is pirated, illegal, or just old. The circulation
      of these images fuel into capitalist media. They are not given credit when it is due which is important because they play
      an important role in society providing rapid circulation, access to visual culture, and information transmission.
