  <h1> WEEKLY 3: THE POOR IMAGE </h1>
  <body>
    <div>
      I had never considered poor images or ones of low quality to be a subject of a political matter. However,
      Hito Steyerl brings to mind many different issues that can be derived just from an image with lower resolution.
      One line that stuck out to me was how "Resolution was fetishized as if its lack amounted to the castration
      of the author." This reveals the contemporary hierarchy of images that is based off of resolution and
      was created out of visual culture.

      The way in which this piece was written felt like a conversation about class. This is highlighted further
      by calling low resolution images "poor" images. There is a certain stigma
      that comes with an image being of bad quality. Either that it is pirated, illegal, or just old. The circulation
      of these images fuel into capitalist media. They are not given credit when it is due which is important because they play
      an important role in society providing rapid circulation, access to visual culture, and information transmission.

      <p> Even though there is a hierachy to crisper, higher resolution images, I feel that individuals
        are always pushing the status quo. Youtuber Joanna Ceddia creates content that has been extremely
        popular seeing her extreme growth. However, her set up and equipment is not of the "highest" quality
        that is expected of most Youtubers. However, this is part of her "brand" and actually contributes
        to her content. I think she is an interesting example when it comes to thinking about the "poor image."
