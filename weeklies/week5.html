    <p> For this Weekly response, I decided to create a GIF about a particular
      concept of the Accelerationist Politics that I found interesting which was the
      merging of human and digital. The GIF is a literal representation of that and I used
      myself as the subject. I found this movement fascinating as it is really relevant today. It
      feels alot like the cybernetics movement in which it was very extreme -- things had to follow
      a certain way for humanity to literally survive.

      <p> It is the celebration of speed and technology which I find is very prevalent
        in society today. It is all about innovating and advancing to create a better quality
        of life for humans, which I feel is the core of accelerationism -- for the benefit of the human
        race.
