    What I gathered from this reading was Marx trying to grapple with how
    automation/ machines/ robots would affect capitalism. Amazingly, this piece
    was written over 150 years ago and we are now reaching a time in society
    where automation, robots, and AI are taking over a lot of labour jobs. I believe
    this piece tries to argue that automation would bring about the end
    of capitalism because once these jobs have been taken, society will develop
    new means of social thought and cooperation outside of the capitalist framework that
    we are bound by today.

    This discussion reminds me a lot of Andrew Yang's "Universal Basic Income" platorm
    point. The concept that every American adult would recieve $1000/ month. Although
    regarded as the "Freedom Dividend" as to relieve extreme poverty, stress, and increase
    bargaining power for workers. However, complete automation is something that is also
    considered in an UBI proposal especially for those who will lose jobs from it. I have
    read up about systems where the profit made from complete automation would contribute
    to a UBI and that there are pilot programs for this happening in the UK and Canada.
    Considering how fast that technology is advancing, I feel the urgency of creating and
    working on legislation in this area to beneift those being affected.
