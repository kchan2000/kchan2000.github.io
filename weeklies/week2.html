  <h1> WEEKLY 2: AYN RAND AND OBJECTIVISM </h1>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>
      Ayn Rand’s philosophy was objectivism which meant that everyone should be motivated out of
selfishness, but even then society is still able to function. What I find the most fascinating about
Ayn Rand is her influence and legacy she left in the tech companies. Her philosophy is lives on
today through Silicon Valley and the new, “human-centered” approach to technology and
innovation. What shocked me the most was how these huge tech owners were naming their
children after her.

This is relevant today in the role that technology and the internet play in our day to day life.
Essentially, the internet and Objectivism go hand in hand, as with the rise of the internet there is
a level of autonomy that each individual has, but we are still able to function as a whole without
outright anarchy and chaos. This was highlighted in the part with the Carpenter’s pong
experiment and the red and green paddles. Watching footage from that moment, you could feel
the excitement of something new. The California Ideology builds upon the last two topics. It
refers to the rise of networking technologies in Silicon Valley as a result of neoliberalism and
politics.
