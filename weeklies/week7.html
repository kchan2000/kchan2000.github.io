    <h1> WEEKLY 7: POEMS & CHAOS </h1>

  <p> This poem is in response to "Breathing: Chaos and Poetry" by Berarchi
    which I found very powerful and poignant. Personally, I love poetry and
    I felt that this reading encapsulated so much of the purpose of poetry
    and emphasized it's importance. One quote that really captured how I felt was
    when the author writes "poetry is precisely the excess that goes beyond the limits
    of language, which is to say beyond the limits of the world itself." This resonated
    with me a lot because I do feel that poetry provides this type of release unlike other
    art forms. </p>

      <p> My poem is entitled 'breathe' and I was trying to play around with the structure
        and words. I tried to capture the internal monologue of a student on the edge of
        burning out and the breaths get longer as the piece goes on, yet the speaker continues
        to ignore them. I wanted to create a suffocating feeling which is why there is an
        absence of spaces. </p>
