        My piece is entitle "Suburbia" and it is about the neighborhood I grew up in and how it has shaped me
        to be the person I am today. This was originally written as a supplemental essay for a college (that I did not get accepted too).
        However, I was really proud of the piece and it is my first piece of published literature.

        Suburbia anywhere has a reputation of being boring and identical everywhere you go. However, this piece is really
        inspired by the little things that make it special. This piece required a lot of introspection to think about <thead>
          places and people that molded me into the person I am today, and identifying these aspects made me all the more grateful
          to have grown up rooted in a diverse community - one that I still feverently call home today.
