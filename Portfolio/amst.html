    <p> <b>"Histories of Empire: Buddae Jjijae" was a short film created for my AMST 220: The Making of Asian America class.
    Inspired by Tasty videos, my group decided to research and speak about how food has played a role in building empires, specifically
  looking at buddae jjigae or "Korea Army Base Stew"</b>
  </div>
  <div class="amst2">
    <p> The film required a lot of preparation and this came in the form of researching, gathering ingredients, to the actual production. None of us
      were film majors or had any previous experience with filming, so it was a huge learning curve for us.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    In the process, we learned the history of the dish itself. Buddae Jjigae is just one example of how US military occupation
    impacted the lives of those across Asia. These were militarized dishes that were created out of
    necessity - similar to dishes like pork sisig in the Philippines - but their modern-day legacy is often forgotten.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    This was a serious feat of coordination and collaboration, but I enjoyed every step of making it. We actually ended up winning
  our classes (very informal) film festival. I hope to create similar content in the future to serve as educational tools when thinking
  about imperalism and empires.</p>
