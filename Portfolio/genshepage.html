    <p> <b> Generation She is a USC student-led non-profit that aims to promote an entrepreneurial mindset and sense of ownership in young girls. Our ultimate goal is to attack the problem at the grass-roots level and empower young women to pursue leadership roles in business.</b>

      Onboarded as part of the Logistics branch of the team, my role involved outreach to brands such as Maybelline, Toms, Tower 28, etc, maintaining partnerships
      with companies such as Jeni's Ice Cream, Health-Ade Kombucha, and Google, and advising CEO Avni Barman on logsitical
      best practices.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This was all for the two-day makeathon that invited young female students interested
      in entrepreneurship to  actively engage in discussions with female entrepreneurs, participate in design thinking and ideation exercises, attend product development and marketing workshops,
      and present their ideas in a final  pitch competition.

      Generation She was founded by Founder & CEO, Avni Barman and 10 female students from the University of Southern who pooled their talents into
       curriculum building, branding, software engineering, and event planning to build a two-day makeathon for entrepreneurially-minded high-school students.

        This was the second Make-A-Thon ever, the first one being held a year ago at the SnapChat headquarters in Los Angeles.
        Every Make-A-Thon and location comes with its own challenges. So, although much was learned from Snapchat, we faced many obstacles
        coming into Lyft in San Francisco </p>
